Almost every project on my Resume is done during these three semesters. I tend to be a little eccentric as a student, and would only selectively assignments I thought I had</p><p><strong>After this</strong>, I&#39;ve had short stints as a tutor, a consultant (machine learning), and a freelancer (making web applications), but I&#39;ve spent the majority of my time teaching, averaging ~7 sections a year for 3 years. My teaching evaluations are decent, with room for improvement, save for two semesters where a lot went wrong. I&#39;ve been able to sustain myself on an adjunct&#39;s salary by also investing in HPC/Semiconductor companies, and as a result, I tend to be well-informed in the area. This is also where my interest in HPC comes from.</p><p>Over these three years, I&#39;ve also grown an interest in the so-called &quot;<a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Software 2.0</a>&quot;, particularly to create tools that facilitate learning.</p><p><strong>In terms of research and publications</strong>, I don&#39;t have much to show. I shortly worked as a Machine learning consultant where I helped write two funding proposals, an SBIR from the Department of Education, and another for NSF on using a reinforcement learning-based intelligent aide for students with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - and so I have some writing experience.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/DhruvDh/semisupervised_nlu#readme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Semi-supervised Natural Language Understanding</a> <strong>is a good example of my writing</strong>, and the introduction does also explain why I am so interested in language models. There are also two posters - <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fo4f4z9bedm2qa0/B11%20Poster.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> (2018), and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tvrgifbub7azgl/Semi-supervised%20NLU.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> (2019), though these only look good.</p><p><strong>In terms of reading</strong>, I used to be very diligent in reading journals and papers during my Master&#39;s, but much less after that. I am not sure why, I&#39;ve known for at least 2.5 years that I was going to apply to a Ph.D. program, I would&#39;ve been in a ridiculously good place to succeed had I just kept up with my readings all this time.</p><p><strong>In terms of recommendations</strong>, I am confident I will have some from Faculty at UNC Charlotte, and also maybe another from the P.I. for the funding proposals I helped write.</p>',15),s=[o];function i(l,d,h,m,p,u){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const f=e(n,[["render",i]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
