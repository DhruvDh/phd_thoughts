I've done a Bachelor's in Information Technology from India, and my Master's in Computer Science here at UNC Charlotte.

**My Bachelor's** were for the most part uneventful, save for gaining some administrative experience during my time serving as the General Secretary of the Student Council, and writing an embarrassing Bachelor's thesis that I now prefer to hide.

**During my Master's**, I was primarily focused on Deep Learning, particularly Language Models, but also Computer Vision and High-Performance Computing. Almost every project on my Resume is done during these three semesters. I tend to be a little eccentric as a student, and would only selectively assignments I thought I had 

**After this**, I've had short stints as a tutor, a consultant (machine learning), and a freelancer (making web applications), but I've spent the majority of my time teaching, averaging ~7 sections a year for 3 years. My teaching evaluations are decent, with room for improvement, save for two semesters where a lot went wrong. I've been able to sustain myself on an adjunct's salary by also investing in HPC/Semiconductor companies, and as a result, I tend to be well-informed in the area. This is also where my interest in HPC comes from.

Over these three years, I've also grown an interest in the so-called "[Software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)", particularly to create tools that facilitate learning.

**In terms of research and publications**, I don't have much to show. I shortly worked as a Machine learning consultant where I helped write two funding proposals, an SBIR from the Department of Education, and another for NSF on using a reinforcement learning-based intelligent aide for students with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - and so I have some writing experience.

[Semi-supervised Natural Language Understanding](https://github.com/DhruvDh/semisupervised_nlu#readme) **is a good example of my writing**, and the introduction does also explain why I am so interested in language models. There are also two posters - [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fo4f4z9bedm2qa0/B11%20Poster.pdf?dl=0) (2018), and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2tvrgifbub7azgl/Semi-supervised%20NLU.pdf?dl=0) (2019), though these only look good.

**In terms of reading**, I used to be very diligent in reading journals and papers during my Master's, but much less after that. I am not sure why, I've known for at least 2.5 years that I was going to apply to a Ph.D. program, I would've been in a ridiculously good place to succeed had I just kept up with my readings all this time.

**In terms of recommendations**, I am confident I will have some from Faculty at UNC Charlotte, and also maybe another from the P.I. for the funding proposals I helped write.
