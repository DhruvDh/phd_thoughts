## Work Experience


-   **Adjunct Lecturer at UNC, Charlotte**\
    *January 2020 - Present*

    Currently teaching ITSC 1212 Introduction to Computer Science 1, ITSC 2214 Data Structures, and ITCS 3134 - Digital Image Processing at the College of Computing and Informatics at UNC, Charlotte. Would have taught 21 sections by the Fall of 2022.

-   **Machine Learning Consultant at Powerhouse Consulting**\
*February 2020 - April 2020*
    
    Helped write two funding proposals, an SBIR from the Department of Education, and another for NSF on using a reinforcement learning-based intelligent aide for students with Autism spectrum disorder
    (ASD).

-   **Tutor at UNC, Charlotte**\
*January 2020 - May 2020*

    Tutored for ITCS 3181 - Introduction to Computer Architecture for the Spring 2020 semester at the College of Computing and Informatics at UNC, Charlotte.

-   **Lowe's Innovation Labs**\
*August 2018 - December 2018*

    Collaborated with Lowe's Innovation Labs for a single project of developing an MVP for a Visual Search system meant to identify products within Lowe's massive product catalog from images. *(Not an internship)*

-   **General Secretary of Students' Council**\
*August 2016 - August 2017*
    
    Served as the General Secretary of the St. Francis Institute of Technology Students' Council (SFITSC) from 2016-2017.

## Academic Projects

-   **Solution for SemEval Task 3: EmoContext**\
    *Natural Language Processing*

    Implemented a moderately successful solution (ranked 44th/241 as of 12/13/2018) for SemEval 2019 Task 3: EmoContext: Contextual Emotion Detection in Text., using a non-traditional Bi-LSTM architecture that used a combination of FastText and some Custom word embeddings, that performed as it did without requiring any significant preprocessing

-   **Semi-supervised Natural Language Understanding**\
    *Natural Language Processing*

    Used generative language models to solve the Natural language Understanding task of user intent identification.

    **Project Link**: https://github.com/DhruvDh/semisupervised_nlu

-   **Visual Search Prototype for Lowe’s**\
    *Computer Vision*

    Collaborated with Lowe’s Innovation Labs to build a visual search system, that given an image, identifies the product within it, using a very small, computationally efficient Convolutional Neural Network. Was trained to detect products across the category of Decorative Light Bulbs.

    **MVP Demo**: https://youtu.be/WmK4QiC-7Ag

-   **Robotic Arm Manipulation using Quaternion Neural Networks**\
    *Intelligent Robotics*

    Trained a Quaternion Neural Network to predict what positions the links in a robotic arm should be in for the end-effector to be placed in the desired position. Effectively did the same job as an inverse kinematics solver but with better computational efficiency.
   
    **Project Link**: https://dhruvdh.github.io/intelligent_robotics_project/

-   **Speech-To-Text**\
    *Web Application*

    A progressive web application that generates transcripts from audios of recorded discussions, meetings, etc., and then uses NLP to perform a rudimentary analysis on them. Used - Vue.js, Node.js, and the Google Cloud Platform.
   
    **Project Demo**: https://youtu.be/KgCdh2ru6jg


-   **Intelligent to-do list**\
    *Web Application*

    An intelligent to-do list web application for students that could "understand" the intention behind a to-do list item and then proceed to classify to-do items and organize them automatically. It is easier to show than to explain, please refer to the demo
   
    **Project Demo**: https://youtu.be/FLrzDlr9oZM

-   **Efficient Implementation of the N-Body problem on CPUs and GPUs**\
    *Web Application*

    Implementation of the N-body problem that is highly optimized for Intel’s Haswell micro-architecture, written in Rust. The GPU implementation leverages CUDA and is written using the Futhark Parallel Programming language.
   
-   **Intent Recognition from Textual User Utterances**\
    *Natural Language Processing*

    Explored the feasibility of using a hierarchy of classifiers to classify the intent of a user, from textual utterances. Using the crowd-sourced Snips NLU dataset of 13,784 user utterances, the approach was found to have an overall accuracy of 95.16% while only using rudimentary text classification techniques such as Logistic Regression
